welcome: |
  Welcome to U.I.U.C. menu checker. How can I help you? Say "help" to know about how to use me.

help: |
  The first thing you can do with me is to check the menu, specifically entrees in dining halls. 
  For example, here are some sample questions. You can ask "What's the dinner today in P.A.R. dining hall?", "What's the the dinner today in P.A.R tomorrow", or simply "Dinner in P.A.R hall today".
  Or you can say "interactive" to let me ask questions about your query. 
  After you got your answers for the entrees, you can continue asking about other things about your query by saying "detail". 
  sYou can try it out now.

filter: |
  Got it. {{ filter_name }} food filter is 
  {% if flag %} activated {% else %} turned off {% endif %}. 
  Say it again if you want to
  {% if flag %} turn it off {% else %} switch it on {% endif %}. 
  You can carry on with your query now. 

inter-ask-hall: |
  Sure. Which dining hall's menu do you want to know?

  Ok. Which meal do you want to know, breakfast, lunch, or dinner?

inter-ask-date: |
  Got it. Do you want it today or tomorrow?

answer-entrees-ask: |
  Sure, {{ date }} in {{ hall }} for {{ meal }}'s entrees, there are {{ results | join(", ") }}. \
  If you want to know more details such as starches, salads, soups and desserts, say "details". 
  You can also start another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

  Here are the details about the {{ meal }} in {{ hall }} {{ date }}. 
  For entrees, there are {{ results_entrees | join(", ") }}; {% if not results_starches == [] %}
